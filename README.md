Symfony (Sons of PHP Edition)
=============================

This is a modified version of Symfony LTS. It is used to setup new projects and
has a few awesome features like:

- Supports "APP_NAME" so that multiple apps can use the same code base. This
  makes it easier to have "api", "admin", and "app" in the same code base.
- Docker files included so you don't need to add anything else
- Sons of PHP bundles and libraries are pre-installed and configured
